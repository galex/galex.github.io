# Introduction

Building Android Apps is harder than building iOS, but for sure doable!
How can we strive to be good Android Developers if building Android Apps is not so trivial?

# Respect The Lifecycle

Android has 4 entry points, 4 types of things the Android OS or other apps can trigger in your app:

- [Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle) are the UI, the "windows", of an app
- [Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/fragments/lifecycle) are parts of the UI of an App
- [Broadcast Receivers](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/broadcasts) are used to trigger something really short without UI
- [Services](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services) are used to run something for longer times without UI
- [Content Providers](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-provider-basics) help you share an interface to other apps
- [Composables](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/lifecycle) are the new UI Toolkit and yes you should learn that.
