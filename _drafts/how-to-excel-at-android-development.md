## Introduction

On Android, there are many ways to do something, but probably one or two that will actually work.
I found out over the years that excellent Android Developers are the ones that adopted the following mindset, and I'd like to share it with you!

## Learn how to build a Screen in your Stack

## Then, learn how to build a Screen well

Building a screen well means more than just doing MVI and what the Design or Product Team required you to do!

Think about the following:
- System-initiated Process Death
- Proper locators for UI Testing
- Accessibility with Talkback
- Deep Links (with and without Process Death)
- Re-usability in multiple modules

## Screens should not make delayed navigation decisions 

// Explain how a screen cannot decide to navigate to another screen while showing UI


## Embrace the Android OS

Meaning, don't fight the Android OS. If you feel you're fighting it, you're doing something wrong.

## Navigation Data and Navigation Logic is UI

## Respect The Lifecycle

## Model View Whatever is fine
