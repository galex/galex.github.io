## Introduction

On Android, there are 10+ ways to do something, but probably one or two that will actually work.
I found out over the years that excellent Android Developers are the ones that adopted the following mindset, and I'd like to share it with you!

## Embrace the Android OS

Meaning, don't fight the Android OS. If you feel you're fighting it, you're doing something wrong.

## Navigation Data and Navigation Logic is part of the UI

## Respect The Lifecycle

## Your Architecture Stack is Good
