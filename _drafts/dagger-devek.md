![Devek means glue](/assets/img/headers-strands-of-glue.png)

The main problem with [API/DI](posts/advanced-modularization-api-impl-vs-api-di/) is the fact that it created boilerplate as the app needs to provide instances between modules.

dagger-devek is a dagger-spi plugin to generate the boilerplate code for us, using naming conventions.

## Conclusion

In short: 

- Type I: One Only Gradle Project, One Only Gradle Subproject
- Type II: One Only Gradle Project, Many Gradle Subprojects
- Type II-B: One Main Gradle Project, One build-logic Gradle Project, Many Gradle Subprojects
- Type III: Many Gradle Projects, Many Gradle Subprojects

Happy modularization! ðŸš€
