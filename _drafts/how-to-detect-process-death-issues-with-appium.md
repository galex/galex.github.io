[Appium](http://appium.io/docs/en/latest/) is a end-to-end (e2e) automation tool.

Let's check how it can help us detect the [Process Death issue](https://galex.dev/posts/how-to-detect-process-death-issues/) present in our demo app.

## Appium Demo Project

I've used the guidelines of [this post](https://medium.com/@benjamin.laschkar/begin-your-android-automation-testing-using-appium-junit5-and-kotlin-in-5-minutes-on-windows-or-4e57cac6e7df) to setup the JVM-based Appium project that we will look at here.

You are welcome to check it out and adapt it to your app or copy only the appropriate pieces.
