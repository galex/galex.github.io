![Old Kotlin In Action book besides new Kotlin In Action Second Edition](/assets/img/kotlin-in-action-second-edition.jpg)

A New book has arrived at my doorstep and I have to tell you about it!

In the era of omnipresent technology and screens blasting our eyes for more than 16 hours a day, I find comfort in reading a physical book made out of real paper, being able to read it wherever I want.

Maybe it's just nostalgia from the times I was learning programming, before StackOverflow (yes, I'm that old 😅).

> ℹ️ I remember having a hard time learning Assembly back then, so I decided to get a little book to help, and it did! Seeing the teacher's face when I explained I've used object oriented-like [structures](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C7-x86_64/structs.html) in **Assembly** was quite priceless! 😂

## Who wrote Kotlin In Action?

Who could explain us Kotlin better than some the creators of the language itself?

- [Sebastian Aigner](https://twitter.com/sebi_io)
- [Dmitry Jemerov](https://twitter.com/intelliyole)
- [Svetlana Isakova](https://twitter.com/sveta_isakova) 
- [Roman Elizarov](https://twitter.com/relizarov)

If you don't follow them on Twitter, you should! 

They share a lot of interesting things about Kotlin and programming in general.

## Who is this for?

If you're a new or an experienced Kotlin developer, this book will not only help you learn about all the features the Kotlin language has to offer, but more importantly **WHY** those features work that way they do.

Those internal insights were what I mostly loved in the first book.

The biggest new addition to the book is a whole new Part 3 which covers **Coroutines** and **Flows**. That was definitely missing from the first edition, so I'm really looking forward to reading it!
